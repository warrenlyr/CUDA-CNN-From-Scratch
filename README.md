# CUDA_CNN_From_Scratch
Build Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and accelerate with CUDA. 
Although there are many sophiscated frameworks out there such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, cuDNN, OpenCV, and Caffe,
this is a part of our final project of High Performance Computing class, to apply what we have learned during the semester.

The "Convolutional Layer" and the "Pooling Layer" are the most computational intensive part of the CNN algorithm,
and it involves matrix operations that we can accelerate using CUDA. Therefore, it's a perfect choice of our final project.

Keywords: Matrix Multiplication, CUDA, Threads, Blocks, Grids, Memory, Cache, Latency, Performance.
